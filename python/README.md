# Alone Pong in Python

This is a project that implements a single-player version of the Pong game, using the Pygame framework in Python.

## How to Run the Game

Before running the game, you need to have Pygame installed in your Python environment. To install it, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install pygame
```

Once Pygame is installed, simply execute the `AlonePong.py` file in your terminal using the command:

```
python3.9 AlonePong.py
```

## Game Features

In this version of the game, there is only one paddle controlled by the player using the arrow keys. The objective is to hit the ball present on the screen to the opposite direction and prevent it from reaching the bottom of the screen. Every time the ball hits the bottom, a new ball starts with a random velocity.

Some features of this project:

- Only one player controlled by the keyboard;
- Movement of the paddle through the arrow keys;
- Each new ball has a random velocity, and the game does not have a defined end;
- Simple and minimalist graphical interface.
